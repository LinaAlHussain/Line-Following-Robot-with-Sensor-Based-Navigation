# Line-Following-Robot-with-Sensor-Based-Navigation
This project is a simple implementation of a line-following robot using three sensors (left, middle, right) to detect the path and DC motors for movement control. The robot uses logic to move forward, make left/right turns, or stop, based on sensor readings.
